   <h1>Breakdown of the Team</h1>

   <div>Strenghts of the Team</div>
   <p>The Suns have put together a very impressive regular season because of the lockdown defense and the high-powered offense. The Suns use a lot of zone defense and look to keep teams out of the paint by clogging the lane with multiple defenders. Since the team has a gluttony of defenders that can guard multiple positions and can cover a lot of ground, the Suns have been one of the best defensive teams in the NBA this year.

</p>

<div>Weaknesses of the Team</div>
<p>The Suns must improve on the offensive end of the court. The team only has two high level playmakers in Devin Booker and Chris Paul, so the offense can often delve into giving the ball to either Chris or Devin and getting out the way. If this team wants to be champions this year the team must do a much better job of moving the ball and playing as a team. </p>
